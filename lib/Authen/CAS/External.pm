=head1 NAME

Authen::CAS::External - Authenticate with CAS servers as a browser
would.

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to L<Authen::CAS::External> version 0.05

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $cas_auth = Authen::CAS::External->new(
      cas_url => 'https://cas.mydomain.com/',
  );

  # Set the username and password
  $cas_auth->username('joe_smith');
  $cas_auth->password('hAkaT5eR');

  my $response = $cas_auth->authentiate();

  my $secured_page = $ua->get($response->destination);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides a way to authenticate with a CAS server just as a browser
would. This is useful with web scrapers needing to login to a CAS
site.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

This is fully object-oriented, and as such before any method can be used, the
constructor needs to be called to create an object to work with.

=head2 new

This will construct a new object.

=over

=item new(%attributes)

C<%attributes> is a HASH where the keys are attributes (specified in the
L</ATTRIBUTES> section).

=item new($attributes)

C<$attributes> is a HASHREF where the keys are attributes (specified in the
L</ATTRIBUTES> section).

=back

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 cas_url

This is the URL of the CAS site excluding /login. This can be a URI object
or a string of a URL.

=head2 password

This is the password to use for logging in to the CAS site. When set, this
clears the L</ticket_granting_cookie>.

=head2 ticket_granting_cookie

This is the ticket granting cookie to use for logging into the CAS site. This
can be set to log in with just the cookie and no usernamd or password.

=head2 username

This is the username to use for logging in to the CAS site. When set, this
clears the L</ticket_granting_cookie>.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 authenticate

This method will authenticate against the CAS service using the presupplied
username and password and will return a L<Authen::CAS::External::Response>
object.

This method takes a HASH with the following keys:

=over

=item gateway

This is a Boolean of if the gateway parameter should be sent to the CAS server.
The default is to not send any gateway parameter.

=item renew

This is a Boolean of if the renew parameter should be sent to the CAS server.
The default is to not send any renew parameter.

=item service

This is a string that specifies the service value to send to the CAS server.
The default is to not send any service parameter.

=back

=head2 get_cas_credentials

This method is not actually used, but is required for classes to consume the
L<Authen::CAS::External::UserAgent> role as this class does. This method will
return the currently set username and password to the user agent.

=head2 get_cas_ticket_granting_cookie

This method is not actually usedm but is required for classes to consume the
L<Authen::CAS::External::UserAgent> role as this class does. This method will
return the currently set ticket granting cookie if the username requested
matches the username set (and always should).
